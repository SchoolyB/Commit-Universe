# 🌌 Commit Universe

> A procedurally generated universe that evolves through git commits.

**This repository IS the universe.** Every commit represents cosmic time passing. Stars ignite, planets form, life emerges, civilizations rise and fall—all told through version control.

The code doesn't run. It just *exists*.

## 🚀 Interact With The Universe

Your actions shape the cosmos!

| Action | Workflow | Effect |
|--------|----------|--------|
| ⭐ **Star this repo** | `star-event.yml` | Triggers 5 cosmic events |
| 📋 **Open an issue** | `issue-event.yml` | Creates 3 cosmic ripples |
| ⏰ **Just wait** | `evolve.yml` + staggered waves | Auto-generates 1-3 events every ~2 min |

**Every interaction adds to the universe's history.**

## ⚡ How It Works

A simulation engine runs automatically every few minutes via GitHub Actions:
1. Loads the current universe state
2. Rolls probabilistic cosmic events
3. Generates new files (stars, planets, life...)
4. Commits the changes
5. Pushes to the repository

**~600-1800 commits per day.** The universe never stops.
